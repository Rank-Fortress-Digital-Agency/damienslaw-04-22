          <h2>How to Catch Up With Your Bookkeeping</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            If bookkeeping for your business has fallen by the wayside, there’s
            never a better time to catch up on it than right now – especially if
            it’s tax season. If your bookkeeping records aren’t in order, you
            risk running up against errors or other common audit triggers for
            the IRS. When you actually undergo the auditing process, your lack
            of proper bookkeeping could open your finances up to further
            scrutiny, penalties, and fees.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Don’t worry – we’re not trying to frighten you. The chances of
            actually getting audited by the IRS are actually fairly low, but
            that won’t be much consolation should it happen to you. So, why risk
            it?
          </p>
          <p>
            If the IRS isn’t your concern, making sure your business is running
            efficiently should be. Having good financial records in place can
            help you assess and adapt your business strategy to capture more
            income. Learning how to read financial
          </p>
          <p>
            statements and analyze them can be very helpful when it's time to
            make decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think it’s too late to play catch-up bookkeeping? It’s not, and it
            may only take a day of your dedicated time to have everything sorted
            out.

          <h2>What is Bookkeeping?</h2>
          <p>
            Bookkeeping, simply put, is the process of recording all financial
            transactions made by your business. This can include everything from
            income and expenses to invoices and receipts. All businesses should
            practice bookkeeping, regardless of their size or industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you may be tempted to just stuff everything into a box and
            forget about it until tax season comes around, this is a huge
            mistake. Not only will it make your taxes more complicated (and
            possibly trigger an audit), but you also won’t have a good handle on
            how your business is actually performing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Tedious? Yes. Important? Also, Yes.</h2>
          <p>
            The bookkeeping process is a tedious job, especially when you are
            playing catch-up. However, recording financial transactions and
            having accurate financial data is crucial to running an efficient
            business. Bookkeeping gives you the ability to track your spending,
            assess your income, and make better financial decisions for your
            business. It’s an essential part of running a successful business,
            and it’s something you should be doing on a regular basis – not just
            once a year.

          <h2>The Double-Entry System</h2>
          <p>
            If you're behind on your bookkeeping, don't worry - you can catch up
            using the double-entry bookkeeping system. This system is used by
            businesses all over the world to record financial transactions, and
            it's easy to learn.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
          <p>
            Every time a financial transaction occurs, it is recorded in two
            places. For example, if you receive cash from a customer, you would
            record the transaction in the "cash" account and the "revenue"
            account.
          </p>
          <p>
            This may seem confusing at first, but it's actually quite simple.
            This is simply a set of rules for recording financial information in
            a financial accounting system. Double-entry bookkeeping ensures that
            every financial transaction is accounted for, so you can be
            confident that your books are accurate. This way when you are asked
            to produce financial statements, you know everything is accounted
            for.

          <h2>How Can I Get Started Catching up on my Bookkeeping?</h2>
          <p>
            Now that you understand the importance of bookkeeping and the basics
            of how it works, it's time to get started.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re starting to feel overwhelmed, don’t worry. We’ve put
            together a simple guide to help you catch up with your bookkeeping
            and get your financial records in order.

          <h2>Gather Receipts & Invoices</h2>
          <p>
            Before you do anything, find out how far behind you are in your
            bookkeeping. You may be just a couple or even several months behind,
            but either way, it’s important to know (and be honest with yourself
            about) how far back into the past you’re going to have to begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you’ve identified the period of time that you need to construct
            your records, start by gathering all of your receipts and invoices.
            This goes beyond the traditional "paper" tracking of financial
            transactions. With online banking and payments, it is important to
            check both digital and paper trails to ensure an accurate recount of
            ALL financial transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sounds simple, right? It might be if you know where all of these
            things are. To clarify, you’re looking for:

                <b>Invoices to Customers</b> - If you send your customers
                invoices, you probably have them saved somewhere on your
                computer or have physical copies in a dedicated folder. If you
                don’t have a method for saving these, we suggest setting one up
                as soon as possible. If you do have old invoices, but they’re
                not saved in an easily accessible format or location, now is the
                time to change that.

                you haven’t been able to collect on their debt to you. This is
                known as bad debt and keeping accurate records of it can allow
                you to factor it into your tax return.

                <b>Business Expenses</b> - It takes money to make money, which
                is why businesses can deduct their expenses from their taxes.
                Make sure you account for all receipts related to expenses you
                intend to deduct, so you can get an accurate reading of your
                income tax liability. An expense account can also include
                payments such as wages and salaries.

                differences between accounts receivable and income statements
                can be tricky. It is important when bookkeeping, to track
                everything.

          <h2>Keep 'Em Separated</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re a sole proprietor, you might find it difficult to separate
            your personal and business expenses when bookkeeping. Unfortunately,
            the IRS requires that you do this – they aren’t interested in
            subsidizing your lifestyle choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to keep track of everything is by using a dedicated
            business credit card for all of your business purchases. This will
            make it much easier to track expenses come tax time, and you can
            even set up automatic payments to ensure you never miss a due date.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t want to open a new line of credit, that’s
            understandable. In this case, we recommend using a separate checking
            account for your business. This will
          </p>
          <p>
            also make it much easier to keep track of your expenses, and you can
            simply transfer money from your personal account to your business
            account as needed.

          <h2>Reconcile Your Bank Statements</h2>
          <p>
            Review your bank records to make sure the income and expenses you
            identified agree with what’s gone into and out of your accounts. If
            your records don’t match what’s showing up on your bank statements,
            it’s likely an indicator that there’s a mission invoice or receipt
            somewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being able to identify when and possibly to whom payment was sent or
            received can help you track down and fill in gaps during your
            catch-up bookkeeping endeavor.

          <h2>Make Sure Business & Personal Expenses Aren’t Mingling</h2>
          <p>
            As previously mentioned, it can be hard to track financial
            transactions when your bookkeeping overlaps with your personal
            finances. It’s more than likely that you have a separate bank
            account you use for your business, but sometimes independent
            contractors find it easier to have their assets flowing in and out
            of one account. If this is the case for you, at least make sure you
            can accurately identify business and personal expenses in your bank
            statements.

          <h2>Avoid an IRS Tax Audit</h2>
          <p>
            Claiming personal expenses as business expenses is a common trigger
            for IRS audits that can lead to harsh penalties or worse if
            egregious enough. Consider opening a small business bank account to
            avoid these two very different types of expenses from being confused
            with one another as you play catch-up bookkeeping.

          <h2>When is it Time to Hire Someone?</h2>
          <p>
            If you find that you’re really struggling to keep track of
            everything, you might want to consider hiring a bookkeeper or
            accountant. This will be an extra expense, but
          </p>
          <p>
            it could save you a lot of headaches (and money) in the long run. A
            bookkeeper is someone who is skilled at keeping documents and
            tracking a wide net of financial information. Working with a tax
            professional can save a lot of headaches and also protect your
            business from any mistakes that can be costly.

          <h2>Digitize & Organize All of Your Records</h2>
          <p>
            If not all of your records are already in digital form, scanning
            them is an important step to preserving them for future reference.
            The IRShas its own guidelines for how long you should hold on to
            your records, but by digitizing everything, you can hold on to them
            all indefinitely.
          </p>
          <p>
            You shouldn’t rely on digital copies, however. It may be a good
            practice to just hold on to your tax returns and receipts for the
            maximum recommended amount of time (seven years). After that, you
            can shred your oldest files every year with the assurance that they
            still exist in a digital form.

          <h2>File Your W-9s, 1099s, & W2s</h2>
          <p>
            Unless you’re a sole proprietor or independent contract with no
            employees or subcontractors, you’ll need to file important tax
            documents.
          </p>
          <p>These documents include:</p>
          <br />
          <h3>W-9 forms</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            You’ll need to provide a W-9 form to any contractor you paid $600 or
            more during the year. The IRS uses this information to track how
            much money you paid out to contractors as well as how much tax they
            owe on that income.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>1099 forms</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            You must provide a 1099 form to any contractor you paid $600 or more
            during the year. The contractor will use this information to file
            their taxes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>W2 forms</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            W2 forms are for employees and show how much money they made during
            the year as well as how much was withheld for taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can get away with not filing 1099s and W2s if you don’t have any
            employees or contractors, but the IRS may come after you if they
            catch wind that you should have been filing them.

          <h2>File Your Business Taxes</h2>
          <p>
            If you haven’t already filed your business taxes, that should be
            your top priority. Depending on the type of business you have, you
            may need to file quarterly or annual taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re not sure how to file your taxes, there are a number of

                $600 for work during the last tax year, you’ll need to file a
                Form W-9 and a Form 1099-MISC. The former will request the
                worker’s taxpayer information, which you’ll use to fill out a
                1099-MISC for the IRS. The 1099-MISC is used by the tax agency
                to account for payments to independent contractions.
